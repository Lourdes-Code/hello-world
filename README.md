# hello-world
## Thi is my first repository. 
I´m doing the Github tutorial

### My name is Bernardita, 
"Berny" for friends and Lourdes for developers and machines ;)
I´m a Nurse ~~but I don’t want to work in hospitals anymore :c ~~.

My goal is to be a web developer, get a good remote worker, travel and live in other countries with my heart-partner.
I am passionate about learning a little, observing nature, walking through the cities, daydreaming, the gym and dancing. Ah! I love cats.Cats are the best thing that exists in the universe, I really love cats. ~~When they rule the world, I want to be their slave and survive the post-apocalyptic future~~.
# I won’t give up, I’ll become a developer.
