# hello-world
## This is my first repository 🎊
I´m doing the Github tutorial

### My name is Bernardita, 
"Berny" for friends and  "Lourdes" for developers and machines ;)

I´m a Nurse, ~~but I don’t want to work in hospitals anymore~~ 

> My goal is to be a web developer, get a good remote worker, travel and live in other countries with my heart-partner.
I am passionate about learning a little, observing nature, walking through the cities, daydreaming, the gym and dancing. Ah! I love cats.Cats are the best thing that exists in the universe, I really love cats. ~~When they rule the world, I want to be their slave and survive the post-apocalyptic future~~.
# I won’t give up, I’ll become a developer 💻 ❤️‍🔥
